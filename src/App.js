        The CodeSandbox implementation is a great way to quickly get started
        with using Gerillass and Sass for web design projects. With the built-in
        CodeSandbox environment, users can start modifying the their Sass files
        right away without the need for any additional setup. The real-time
        preview pane in CodeSandbox also allows users to see their changes as
        they're making them, which is a great way to experiment with different
        design ideas.
